# Feminism Throughout History and literature
## How digital history can change the way students research and give a larger, more accurate vision of history.
Living in 2021, it is safe to say that the world has an endless amount of problems to work through and ultimately find solutions for. Inequality for example, is a **huge** issue we face today and it is an umbrella of many problems in the world. Inequality of ethnicity, religion/ beliefs, social standing and opportunities, just to name a few. However, I will be discussing **a brief history of the inequalities of genders and What we can learn about the early movements towards feminism using literary history.** Now you may be asking "_what does literary history have to do with feminism?_" Or even "_why does learning about the early movements towards feminism matter?_" I would reply,"**Wow, what a great question! Allow me to paint a visual of what we as a society have to gain by learning the history of deep rooted problems, as it can be beneficial in how to move forward without a chance of repeating similar mistakes.** This brief history may surprise you, the movement of feminism spans back further than you think. To keep this "brief", I will specially be discussing the area we now call _the United Kingdom,_ using the help of women's literary history taken from the [Orlando Project](http://orlando.cambridge.org) to help us understand why the history of women and feminism specially is important. It is equally important to note that most of the written works, were works of fiction. They cannot be taken as truth, however, many written works were often a reflection of the time or a popular fable told. These are still very important to study as they give us insight to peoples values.

That was the plan at least. While starting this project, I got the idea from reading the homepage of [Orlando Project](http://orlando.cambridge.org) I liked the visual of thinking of women's literary history as an oak tree. Oaks are known to be large, sturdy trees. The first literary works written by women like Mary de France could be seen as the roots taking hold, growing deep into the earth, I like to think of Queen Elizabeth I and the women of her time as the base of the tree growing strong. Moving in to the 17th and 18th century with women like Mary Wollstone, and Jane Austin, being the first of the branches spreading. While the 19th century with the Bronte sisters and Virginia Woolf filling out the tree. The 20th and 21st century allows for the tree to grow bigger and stronger while women protest for equal rights, to be allowed to vote and to work.

However, this will not be the project presented. I am a person who gets an idea, and becomes so obsessed with making sure that the idea gets to be presented. After reading through the *Orlando Project's* entire website of how they started, where they are now, how to use their data base, ect., I found out that you need a subscription in order to access said data base. With a pretty tight due date for this project, I did not have enough time in order to ask the university's library if they could put in for a 30-day free trial. As most sane people would, my first thought was to abandon ship and fine a resource that would allow me to complete this assignment. That's not what happened. After putting some thought into it, looking through some of the other assigned sources, I could not let go of my idea. I really wanted to present this exact idea, exactly how I saw it in my mind.

I decided that because I already have some background knowledge in early English literature, that with the sources given from my English class and some intense time spent doing reach through the library's database that I would be able to come up with something that help me with this. It would have, if I had a few weeks to work on this. Again, I do not. However, with the due date quickly approaching I did not have time to start on another project.

To visually represent the oak tree of women's literature throughout the ages, I planned on using a site called [storymaps](https://storymap.knightlab.com/?utm_content=buffer9716d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer). Instead of using a map, I would upload my an image of an Oak tree, I would then plot my points on the tree, as I mentioned above. I attempted this, but the the site decided to make the image a title of images instead of one singular one. At this point, I gave up a little, nothing was working the way I had wanted or how I envisioned it, no matter how many times I made a tweak in the plan. After sometime of debating what I should do, what my limited options were, I decided that I would just roll with it, I really wanted to see this vision come to life. Even though my map/ image wasn't one large, I chose one of the tree tiles and made my plots starting at the roots as planned. Turns out, that even though I plotted my points on top of one of the tree images, they points moved once I saved and hit "present." ![mapping](mappinf.png) 

When I decided to go ahead with this project plan with out the use of any data, to go purely off of research and some general knowledge, I did not realize how difficult it would be. I needed a list of all the written works from women dating as far back possible, I planned to then select a few notable names with the best examples of strong women and what sort of roles women held at those specific times. Due to the time limit of this project, this was not going to work, though I did try. I did happen upon some good fortune while research, I found a list of notable women as early feminist in the United Kingdom. Which is how I chose the women I included on my tree. Though I only had the time to plot the names and not the information.

Although this project was just short of a failure, considering I was only able to give a visual of what I had planned to do, and the introduction to the original project, I learned a lot. The most important lesson being, always check to see if the data is available to the general public or through the school library. Secondly, I learnt the importance of digital history, for archives and data sources to be as accurate as possible and to be accessible for students and historians. Digital history can really change the way people think and learn about history, it has for me. Before this class and this project, it never occurred to me that the sources we have access to online, or the sources we're given in our textbooks and classes are not always the full extent of the source. It is someones job to pick and choose what is important about a source and what is not, which determines what is uploaded. Digitalizing history allows for us to get the full picture of history, to piece together things we may not connect. Digital history allows for missing voices to be heard. People are working on decolonizing histories or finding women's written works when the world did allow for women to publish their stories. There is so much more that can be done and can be found with the help of digital history. Even though my overall project did not workout the way I had hoped, I do hope that one day in the future when digital history has grown into an even larger field and is more accessible I can come back to this and complete my vision.

Heres to the future of learning, to digital history and painting a more complete picture of our pasts.
